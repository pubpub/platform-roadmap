# PubPub Platform Public Roadmap
üëâ [Visit the current roadmap for PubPub Platform, updated roughly monthly.](https://github.com/orgs/pubpub/projects/46)

The purpose of this repository is to communicate the high-level roadmap for PubPub Platform development.

We welcome ideas, feature requests, bug reports, and general feedback at the [PubPub Platform Discussion Forum](https://github.com/pubpub/platform/discussions), which we use to determine our roadmap.
You can see our sprint-by-sprint workstream, which contains a more granular view of what we're currently working on, or planning to work on, in the next few weeks, [here](https://github.com/orgs/pubpub/projects/43/views/1).

## Reading the Roadmap
Our roadmap is organized in three ways: by quarter expected, by status, and by product theme.
You can view the roadmap by quarter expected or by status using the view tabs, and filter either one by product themes using the "slices" pane on the left.
We update the roadmap roughly monthly, and typically add a status update when we do so to call out any high-level changes, emerging themes, or other important-to-know information.

### Quarter Expected
This is the quarter by which when we expect to finish the described work. 
This is meant to be directional, especially as we go further out into the year, as priorities will almost always change. 
We may, for example, start the work in the prior quarter, and we may end up scoping the work down more narrowly than described in each item in order to complete the key parts of it. 
But once a quarter starts, we try to complete the majority of the work expected by that quarter by its end.

### Status
All items on the roadmap represent work that is not yet completed. 
Once the work is complete and the items close, we archive them so that they are no longer taking up space on board.
To see granular descriptions of completed work, visit the Platform repo's closed [pull requests](https://github.com/pubpub/platform/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
We will soon be adding automated changelog documentation so you can view completed work in a more friendly format.

#### üìù In Review
We are still considering and specifying the work, and it is subject to major change or abandonment.
Usually, work in this state is just a discussion (often initiated by one of you in our [forum](https://github.com/pubpub/platform/discussions)!) or a rough outline.
Work that is several quarters out tends to be in review.
By the time a quarter starts, most work should be planned, moved back, or, if no longer relevant, archived.

#### üìã Planned
We have discussed the work, and typically, produced a design document or series of task issues in our [sprint-by-sprint workstream board](https://github.com/orgs/pubpub/projects/43/views/),
often using a workshop, user interview, or other technique to help refine the concept.
Typically, this means we are committing to doing some version of the work, as described, at some point in the next year or so.

#### üèóÔ∏è In Progress
Work on the items has started.
Typically, this means we have written a series of task issues and mockups for the work in our [sprint-by-sprint workstream board](https://github.com/orgs/pubpub/projects/43/views/).
When work is finished, it is archived.
If the work was scoped down from its original description, we will typically create a new in review roadmap item to represent the rest of the work.

### Product Theme
Product themes are the high-level, narrative points of focus for our work for the forseeable future. 
These tend to evolve every six months or so, but we expect to work on each theme for at least that long before rolling on to others.
Our current themes are:

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Low-Cost Legacy Migration
We are building the tools to allow users to migrate off of Legacy, which we are planning to sunset this year, and onto the platform of their choice.
This theme includes all the work we're doing to make the migration as exciting and smooth as possible for Legacy users.
For those who wish to migrate to PubPub Platform, we are working on building tools that will enable communities to migrate to an equivalent experience on Platform at low cost and minimal disruption.
For more information, read [our post](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/updates/pubpub-platform/) on the migration.

#### üè≠ Cost-Effective Replication
A key to our model is making sure communities can both take advantage of the innovative Knowledge Applications others are doing and, if they choose to, share their own work with others. 
This theme focuses on the tools that allow innovative work on platform to be replicated easily and cost-effectively by all.

#### ‚úÇÔ∏è Customization
PubPub Platform was built to be incredibly flexible, extensible, and to integrate with other common and popular tools, standards, and frameworks.
This theme focuses on the ways we will make that possible for all communities.

#### üí° Innovations
Because PubPub Platform is so flexible, we can rapidly experiment with new and emerging standards, tools, platforms, and inventions that our community brings to our attention.
This theme represents the work we're doing to push the envelope and create brand new ways of making information useful for our users and partners.

#### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Tools
PubPub Platform won't be successful unless it's stable and performant, and others can build on top of it.
This theme includes the work we're doing either to make day-to-day work more effective and impactful for PubPub developers and contributors,
or work to allow developers to build on top of PubPub Platform.
